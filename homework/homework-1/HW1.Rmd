# Case study: Major League Baseball {-}

What is the relationship between payroll and wins among Major League Baseball (MLB) teams? In this homework, we'll find out by wrangling, exploring, and modeling the dataset in `data/MLPayData_Total.csv`, which contains the winning records and the payroll data of all 30 MLB teams from 1998 to 2014.

The dataset has the following variables:

- `payroll`: total team payroll (in billions of dollars) over the 17-year period 
- `avgwin`: the aggregated win percentage over the 17-year period
- `Team.name.2014`: the name of the team
- `p1998`, ..., `p2014`: payroll for each year (in millions of dollars)
- `X1998`, ..., `X2014`: number of wins for each year
- `X1998.pct`, ..., `X2014.pct`: win percentage for each year

We'll need to use the following `R` packages:
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # tidyverse
library(ggrepel)    # for scatter plot point labels
library(kableExtra) # for printing tables
library(cowplot)    # for side by side plots
```

# Wrangle (30 points for correctness; 5 points for presentation)

## Import (5 points)

- Import the data into a `tibble` called `mlb_raw` and print it. 
- How many rows and columns does the data have? 
- Does this match up with the data description given above? 

[Hint: If your working directory is `stat-471-fall-2021/homework/homework-1`, then you can use a *relative path* to access the data at `../../data/MLPayData_Total.csv`.]

**asdf**


## Tidy (15 points)

The raw data are in a messy format: Some of the column names are hard to interpret, we have data from different years in the same row, and both year-by-year and aggregate data are present. 

- Tidy the data into two separate `tibbles`: one called `mlb_aggregate` containing the aggregate data and another called `mlb_yearly` containing the year-by-year data. `mlb_aggregate` should contain columns named `team`, `payroll_aggregate`, `pct_wins_aggregate` and `mlb_yearly` should contain columns named `team`, `year`, `payroll`, `pct_wins`, `num_wins`. Comment your code to explain each step. 

- Print these two `tibbles`. How many rows do `mlb_aggregate` and `mlb_yearly` contain, and why?

[Hint: For `mlb_yearly`, the main challenge is to extract the information from the column names. To do so, you can `pivot_longer` all these column names into one column called `column_name`, `separate` this column into three called `prefix`, `year`, `suffix`, `mutate` `prefix` and `suffix` into a a new column called `tidy_col_name` that takes values `payroll`, `num_wins`, or `pct_wins`, and then `pivot_wider` to make the entries of `tidy_col_name` into column names.]

**Solution.**

## Quality control (10 points)

It's always a good idea to check whether a dataset is internally consistent. In this case, we are given both aggregated and yearly data, so we can check whether these match. To this end, carry out the following steps:

- Create a new `tibble` called `mlb_aggregate_computed` based on aggregating the data in `mlb_yearly`, containing columns named `team`, `payroll_aggregate_computed`, and `pct_wins_aggregate_computed`. 

- Ideally, `mlb_aggregate_computed` would match `mlb_aggregate`. To check whether this is the case, join these two `tibbles` into `mlb_aggregate_joined` (which should have five columns: `team`, `payroll_aggregate`, `pct_wins_aggregate`, `payroll_aggregate_computed`, and `pct_wins_aggregate_computed`.) 

- Create scatter plots of `payroll_aggregate_computed` versus `payroll_aggregate` and `pct_wins_` `aggregate_computed` versus `pct_wins_aggregate`, including a 45$^\circ$ line in each. Display these scatter plots side by side, and comment on the relationship between the computed and provided aggregate statistics.  

**Solution.**


# Explore (40 points for correctness; 7 points for presentation)

Now that the data are in tidy format, we can explore them by producing visualizations and summary statistics.

## Payroll across years (15 points)

- Plot `payroll` as a function of `year` for each of the 30 teams, faceting the plot by `team` and adding a red dashed horizontal line for the mean payroll across years of each team. 

- Using `dplyr`, identify the three teams with the greatest `payroll_aggregate_computed`, and print a table of these teams and their `payroll_aggregate_computed`. 

- Using `dplyr`, identify the three teams with the greatest percentage increase in payroll from 1998 to 2014 (call it `pct_increase`), and print a table of these teams along with `pct_increase` as well as their payroll figures from 1998 and 2014. 

- How are the metrics `payroll_aggregate_computed` and `pct_increase` reflected in the plot above, and how can we see that the two sets of teams identified above are the top three in terms of these metrics?

[Hint: To compute payroll increase, it's useful to `pivot_wider` the data back to a format where different years are in different columns. Use `names_prefix = "payroll_` inside `pivot_wider` to deal with the fact column names cannot be numbers. To add different horizontal lines to different facets, see [this webpage](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-to-add-different-horizontal-lines-to-different-facets/20871).]

**Solution.**

## Win percentage across years (10 points)

- Plot `pct_wins` as a function of `year` for each of the 30 teams, faceting the plot by `team` and adding a red dashed horizontal line for the average `pct_wins` across years of each team. 

- Using `dplyr`, identify the three teams with the greatest `pct_wins_aggregate` and print a table of these teams along with `pct_wins_aggregate`. 

- Using `dplyr`, identify the three teams with the most erratic `pct_wins` across years (as measured by the standard deviation, call it `pct_wins_sd`) and print a table of these teams along with `pct_wins_sd`. 

- How are the metrics `payroll_aggregate_computed` and `pct_wins_sd` reflected in the plot above, and how can we see that the two sets of teams identified above are the top three in terms of these metrics?

**Solution.**

## Win percentage versus payroll (10 points)

The analysis goal is to study the relationship between win percentage and payroll. 

- Create a scatter plot of `pct_wins` versus `payroll` based on the aggregated data, labeling each point with the team name using `geom_text_repel` from the `ggrepel` package and adding the least squares line. 

- Is the relationship between `payroll` and `pct_wins` positive or negative? Is this what you would expect, and why? 

**Solution.**

## Team efficiency (5 points)

Define a team's *efficiency* as the ratio of the aggregate win percentage to the aggregate payroll---more efficient teams are those that win more with less money. 

- Using `dplyr`, identify the three teams with the greatest efficiency, and print a table of these teams along with their efficiency, as well as their `pct_wins_aggregate` and `payroll_aggregate`. 

- In what sense do these three teams appear efficient in the previous plot? 

Side note: The movie ["Moneyball"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/) portrays "Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to assemble a baseball team on a lean budget by employing computer-generated analysis to acquire new players."

**Solution.**


# Model (15 points for correctness; 3 points for presentation)

Finally, we build a predictive model for `pct_wins_aggregate` in terms of `payroll_aggregate` using the aggregate data `mlb_aggregate`.

## Running a linear regression (5 points)

- Run a linear regression of `pct_wins_aggregate` on `payroll_aggregate` and print the regression summary. 
- What is the coefficient of `payroll_aggregate`, and what is its interpretation? 
- What fraction of the variation in `pct_wins_aggregate` is explained by `payroll_aggregate`?

**Solution.**

## Comparing Oakland Athletics to the linear trend (10 points)

- Given their payroll, what is the linear regression prediction for the winning percentage of the Oakland Athletics? What was their actual winning percentage?

- Now run a linear regression of `payroll_aggregate` on `pct_wins_aggregate`. What is the linear regression prediction for the `payroll_aggregate` of the Oakland Athletics? What was their actual payroll?

**Solution.**
